## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")


load(file = "house_elections.rda")
load(file="candidates.rda")
load(file="committees.rda")
load(file="contributions.rda")
```


```{r}

elections_1 <- house_elections %>% 
                  select(fec_id,state,incumbent,candidate_name,party,primary_votes,ge_winner)

names(elections_1)[names(elections_1) == 'state'] <- 'STATE'


contr <- contributions %>% 
                  select(state,name,transaction_amt,cand_id,transaction_type,state)%>% 
                  filter(transaction_type%in%c("24A","24E","24N","24F")) %>% 
                  mutate(Cand_Funding=if_else(transaction_type%in%c("24E","24F"),"FOR","AGAINST"))


names(elections_1)[names(elections_1) == 'fec_id'] <- 'cand_id'

contr_incum <-contr  %>%
  inner_join(elections_1, by = "cand_id")%>% 
    group_by(cand_id,Cand_Funding,candidate_name,party,cand_id,ge_winner,incumbent,STATE) %>%
  summarise(num = n(),
              totalDonation = sum(transaction_amt)) %>% 
  spread(key = Cand_Funding,value=totalDonation)
  

```



```{r}
MA<-contr_incum %>%
  filter(STATE== "MA")%>%
  select(candidate_name,cand_id,party,cand_id,ge_winner,incumbent,STATE,FOR,AGAINST,num)
# looks @ MA data ONLY

ggplot(data=MA,aes(x=candidate_name,y=FOR, fill=incumbent,na.rm=F))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")

ggplot(data=MA,aes(x=candidate_name,y=AGAINST, fill=incumbent,na.rm=F))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")


```



```{r}
types_con <- contributions %>%     
          group_by(transaction_type) %>% 
          summarise(N=n())
#gives amount of unique transaction types

#rapply(contributions,function(x)length(unique(x))) 
```
